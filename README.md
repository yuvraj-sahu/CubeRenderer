# CubeRenderer
Java Cube-Rendering Program

This is a java program that currently renders a cube and allows you to move it and rotate it. To use, run the CubeRenderer.java file. You can see the button mapping in the GraphableCube.java file in comments (right above the keyPressed() method).

If you would like to see my previous versions, each version will be tagged with v<version_name> starting with v0. Enjoy!
